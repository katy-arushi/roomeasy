# RoomEasy üè†
**RoomEasy** is a app made for making roommate matches for college dorms. 

By filling out profile surveys and quizzes to assess personality and lifestyle, students will match with potential roommates and minimize conflict before it begins.

RoomEasy was made as part of [McHacks 9](https://www.mchacks.ca/) and built in 36 hours by [Arushi Katyal](https://github.com/katy-arushi), [Priscilia Momo](https://github.com/pripri99), [Jarvis He](https://github.com/Ilikedietpepsi), and [Ravish Mahajan](https://github.com/ravishmahajan08).
